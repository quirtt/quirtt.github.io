I'm **Himadri Mandal**, 18, you might know me as **quirtt** from Discord/AoPS, as I use that name on the internet. I am a freshman at ISI Kolkata, India studying Statistics (well, mostly Mathematics, but I enjoy both). 
I am also a CS nerd, enjoy almost anything geeky, and have a deep interest in wanting to automate all of Mathematics, and wish to work on this a lot.

You could check some of my projects out on github, but it could be difficult as they are largely undocumented.
I am usually found: learning math/cs, reading ML papers, playing table tennis, chilling with friends, singing badly in my room, etc.
Ah well. I have been recently getting more and more interested in AI and AI alignment, too. I wish do some good work in that field as well.

If you find me interesting - feel free to shoot me a mail at **mandalhimadri06\@gmail.com** or send me a "Hi!" on my Discord.
