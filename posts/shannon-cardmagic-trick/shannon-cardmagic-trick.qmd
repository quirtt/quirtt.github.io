This was my statistics project at ISI Sem 1. My team had: *Myself*, *Siddhartha*, *Ayan*, *Drishti*, *Aman*, *Mrittika*. Thanks to everyone for their efforts.

## Setup

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The magician sends you a deck of cards. You riffle shuffle it *three* times. You pick the card from the top and put it back in the deck, *somewhere*. You send the deck back to the magician. Can he find the chosen card?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What do you think? Well, I guess I wouldn't have asked this question if this weren't possible. Yep - it is possible to do it *reliably* well.

I couldn't believe it myself. However, I think it will make more sense when I present the algorithm which was (apparently) discovered by Shannon. We will talk about this in part A. And implement it in part B. In the subsequent parts, we investigate what happens if we play with the setup a little bit.

## Part A: Shannon's Algorithm

Remember the original orientation of the deck of cards. Label the cards in this orientation $$ 
    \{1,2,\cdots,52\}
$$

Now, we define ***rising sequence decomposition.*** To decompose a deck into its rising sequences we go through the following algorithm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Algorithm*: {#algorithm-risingseq}

1.  Start with 1.

2.  Find the next number, **If** it is *after* the previous number, goto **step 2**. **Else**, continue.

3.  This is a rising sequence. Start with the next unconsidered number, and goto **step 2**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if the deck is $\{4,3,5,1,2\}$. we go $1\to 2 \implies (1,2)$, $3 \implies (3)$, $4 \to 5 \implies (4,5)$, thus $\{4,3,5,1,2\} \implies (1,2)(3)(4,5)$.

Well, it's time to reveal the secret algorithm that Shannon came up with:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Algorithm*:

**Perform the rising sequence decomposition of the final deck. There exists a unique rising sequence singleton in this deck - this is the picked card.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our team implemented the algorithm in **R** and the results were extremely satisfactory.

## Part B: Implementation

#### Version 1: Distribution fitting

We first cut a standard deck 100 times (LOL IN REAL LIFE) and we recorded the number of cards in the smaller deck (Let this vector be $X$). I was going to fit the Gaussian distribution over the vector $c(X,52-X)$.

However, I noticed my skill issue when **\@Ayan** pointed out that this dataset would not be **IID**. To fix this issue, I tossed a coin 100 times and picked either $x \text{ or } 52-x$ for every $x \in X$. Fitting the Gaussian distribution over this we ended up with

``` r
floor(rnorm(1, mean=25.78, sd = 2.3046))
```

Everything else was fairly easy to implement, I had quite some fun while making this. This empirically confirms that the algorithm works with pretty high probabilities $\left(\sim 91\%\right)$.

```{r}
#Cards is the permutation _Sigma_.

Dataset = c(26,26,24,26,26,25,26,26,25,23,25,26,24,26,24,26,26,23,20,26,23,22,25,23,26,26,23,25,23,25,25,25,25,26,25,23,25,24,26,25,26,23,26,23,26,24,26,24,25,24,25,23,24,25,22,21,25,25,25,21,23,24,23,21,26,25,25,24,24,25,24,25,24,24,23,25,21,25,26,26,23,25,25,23,21,24,21,25,25,22,24,25,26,23,24,25,19,25,23,25)

  ### is a unique Rising Singleton

  vals = c(1, rbinom(1, 52, 0.5))

  ### Simulates Process 10000 and counts how many times  
  ### there is a unique Rising Singleton which is also indeed
  ### the picked card.

    Sum = Sum + Process(Cards)
  }
  return(Sum)

Cards = 1:52

Also, **\@Siddhartha** implemented this in Python

```{python}
import random
import numpy as np

Dataset = [
    26, 26, 24, 26, 26, 25, 26, 26, 25, 23, 25, 26, 24, 26, 24, 26, 26, 23, 20, 26, 23, 22, 25, 23, 26,

]

def riffle_shuffle(cards):
    new_deck = []
    split = int(np.random.normal(25.78, 2.3046))
    left_hand = cards[:split]
    right_hand = cards[split:]
   
    for x in range(1, 53):
        l = len(left_hand)
        r = len(right_hand)
        hand = np.random.choice(["L", "R"], p=[l / (l + r), r / (l + r)])
       
        if hand == "L":

cards = [i+1 for i in range(52)]
sum_calculator(cards)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Version 2: Splitting using $\operatorname{Bin}\left(52, \frac{1}{2}\right)$

``` r
#Cards is the permutation _Sigma_.

RiffleShuffle <- function(Cards){
  ...
  split = rbinom(1, 52, 1/2)
  ...
}
```

Where I only change how I perform the split. This results in about $\left(89\%\right)$.
