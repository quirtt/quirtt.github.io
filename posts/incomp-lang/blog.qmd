I had thought of this idea last year, but never got around to writing it. In this blog, I show how humans are infinitely limited by the mode of language in transmission of ideas. I don't quite remember how I got around to thinking about this, but here goes haha.

Every written language is described by a finite set of characters. Every spoken language requires a finite sequence of sounds. Every idea that is realized by humans and communicated through language has to be put into a sequence of letters / sequence of sounds. Call such a thought *expressible*.

I define languages to be made of *fixed* objects, i.e., there are no new characters. A reasonable contention would be: "this is BS? languages change all the time". Well, yes. However, if they change, then I call the new object a new language. You can think of this as:

$$
\{\text{eng\_v1}, \text{eng\_v2}, \text{eng\_v3}\cdots\}
$$

\<***fill in***: why the set of all languages is countable\>

### Theorem

The set of all languages is countable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Theorem

If the set of all possible spoken and written languages is **countable** then the set of *expressible* ideas is **countable**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Proof.*

Let $S$ be the set of all languages. For a language, $L \in S$, let $\mathcal{C}(L)$ be the characters of $L$. We understand that, $|\mathcal{C}(L)|<\infty.$

Define $\mathcal{C}(S) = \cup_{L \in S}\{(L, x) : x\in \mathcal{C}(L) \}$, which is the set of all characters (signed with the language it belongs to). Since $S$ is countable, $\mathcal{C}(S)$ is countable.

Now, every *expressible* idea is a finite sequence of characters/phonemes like:

$$
\gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_3 \gamma_4 \cdots \gamma_N
$$

where $\gamma_i \in \mathcal{C}(S)$.

Let $\mathrm{I}$ be the set of all expressible ideas. We know that set of all finite sequences formed using countable characters is countable, and therefore: $\mathrm{I}$ be countable. $\blacksquare$
